## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using Kobalte Elements in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment and offsets.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
