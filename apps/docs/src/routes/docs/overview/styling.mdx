# Styling

Kobalte Elements are unstyled, giving you complete control over the look and feel. You can bring your styling solution of choice (vanilla CSS, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS libraries, etc...).

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a Dialog Overlay won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `class` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-*` attribute. For example, when an Accordion Item is opened, it includes a `data-expanded` attribute.

## Styling a component part

Every component comprises multiple parts that can be styled. For example, the dialog component has the following parts: content, trigger, title, and backdrop.

The `data-part` attribute can be used to select and style a component part.

Here's what a sample HTML for the dialog looks like:

```tsx

```

You can style each part using the CSS attribute selector.

```css
[data-part="backdrop"] {
  background-color: #000;
  opacity: 0.5;
}

[data-part="content"] {
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 6px;
}
```

## Styling a state

When a component or its parts can have multiple states, we automatically attach `data-*` attributes that represents the specific state. For example, an accordion's trigger can have:

- `data-disabled` — When the trigger is disabled.
- `data-expanded` — When the trigger is expanded.

You can style the accordion's trigger using the CSS attribute selector.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-expanded] {
  background: red;
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-disabled] {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

You'll see this pattern across every component within the library.

## Extending a component

Extending a Kobalte component is done the same way you extend any SolidJS component.

```tsx
import { Accordion as BaseAccordion } from "@kobalte/elements";
import { ComponentProps } from "solid-js";

const AccordionItem = (props: ComponentProps<BaseAccordion.Item>) => {
  return <BaseAccordion.Item {...props} />;
};
```

## Changing the rendered element

All component parts that render a DOM element have an `as` prop. This is useful when you want a part to attach its accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

If you decide to change the underlying node rendered by Kobalte Elements (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it is up to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.

Here's an example of how you can use a custom button called `MyButton` as the trigger for a `Popover.Trigger`:

```tsx
import { Popover } from "@kobalte/elements";
import { MyButton } from "./my-button";

export default () => {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <Popover.Trigger as={MyButton}>Open dialog</Popover.Trigger>
      <Popover.Content>...</Popover.Content>
    </Popover>
  );
};
```
