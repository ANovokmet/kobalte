# Introduction

Kobalte is a UI toolkit for building accessible web apps and design systems with SolidJS.

_Kobalte Elements_ provides a set of low-level UI components and primitives with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience, which can act as a base layer for your design system implementation.

## Key features

### Accessible

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) where possible. Kobalte Elements handle the implementation details related to accessibility, focus management, and keyboard navigation.

### Composable

Kobalte Elements provides granular access to each component parts, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Unstyled

Components ship with zero styles, giving you complete control over the look and feel. You can bring your styling solution of choice (vanilla CSS, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS libraries, etc...).

## Acknowledgment

Kobalte would not have been possible without the prior art done by other meaningful projects from the frontend community including:

- [Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/) - A toolkit for building accessible web apps with React.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) - A library of React Hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for your design system.
- [Zag](https://zagjs.com/) - UI components powered by Finite State Machines.
