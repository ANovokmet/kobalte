# Introduction

Kobalte is a UI toolkit for building accessible web apps and design systems with SolidJS.

The `@kobalte/elements` package provides a set of low-level UI components and primitives which can act as a base layer for your design system implementation.

## Key features

### Accessible

Components follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) whenever possible. Kobalte Elements handle accessibility implementation details like ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.

### Composable

Kobalte Elements provides granular access to each component parts, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Unstyled

Components are shipped with zero styles, allowing you to completely customize the look and feel. Bring your preferred styling solution (vanilla CSS, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS libraries, etc...).

## Acknowledgment

Kobalte Elements would not have been possible without the prior art done by other meaningful projects from the frontend community including:

- [Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/) - A toolkit for building accessible web apps with React.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) - A library of React Hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for your design system.
