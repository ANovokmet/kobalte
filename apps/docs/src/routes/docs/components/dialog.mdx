# Dialog

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Content behind a modal dialog is inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

## Import

```ts
import { Dialog } from "@kobalte/core";
```

## Features

- Follow the [WAI ARIA Dialog](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/) design pattern.
- Supports modal and non-modal modes.
- Hide the content outside the dialog from assistive technologies while it is open, in the modal mode.
- Provides screen reader announcements via rendered title and description.
- Focus is trapped and scrolling is blocked while it is open.
- Pressing <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> closes the dialog.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.

## Anatomy

The dialog consists of:

- **Dialog**: Contains all the parts of a dialog.
- **Dialog.Trigger**: The button that opens the dialog.
- **Dialog.Portal**: Portals its children into the `body` when the dialog is open.
- **Dialog.Overlay**: The layer that covers the inert portion of the view when the dialog is open.
- **Dialog.Positioner**: A wrapper component to help positioning the dialog panel on screen.
- **Dialog.Content**: The element that visually represents a dialog. Contains the content to be rendered when the dialog is open.
- **Dialog.CloseButton**: The button that closes the dialog.
- **Dialog.Title**: An accessible title to be announced when the dialog is opened.
- **Dialog.Description**: An optional accessible description to be announced when the dialog is opened.

```tsx
<Dialog>
  <Dialog.Trigger />

  <Dialog.Portal>
    <Dialog.Overlay />
    <Dialog.Positioner>
      <Dialog.Content>
        <Dialog.CloseButton />
        <Dialog.Title />
        <Dialog.Description />
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Positioner>
  </Dialog.Portal>
</Dialog>
```
