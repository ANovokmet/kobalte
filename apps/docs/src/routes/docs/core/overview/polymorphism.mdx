# Polymorphism

All component parts that render a DOM element have an `asChild` prop.

Paired with the `<As>` component this allows you to attach a component accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

The below example demonstrate how to use a custom button called `MyButton` as the trigger for a `Popover`:

```tsx {6-8}
import { As, Popover as KPopover } from "@kobalte/core";
import { MyButton } from "./my-button";

export const Popover = () => {
  return (
    <KPopover.Root>
      <KPopover.Trigger asChild>
        <As component={MyButton}>Open</As>
      </KPopover.Trigger>
      <KPopover.Content>...</KPopover.Content>
    </KPopover.Root>
  );
};
```

When using this pattern the following rules apply to the component with the `asChild` prop, and it's child `<As>` component :

- CSS classes are combined.
- Styles are combined, if same attribute exists the one from `<As>` win.
- Event handlers are chained, The one from `<As>` get called first.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you decide to change the default rendered node (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it's up
  to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.
